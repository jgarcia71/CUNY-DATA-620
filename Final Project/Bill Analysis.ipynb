    "# Bill Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This script takes the most and least central bills and analyzes their texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the data about the most and least central bills from the jupyter notebook that ranks senators and bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most / Least Central Bills\n",
    "\n",
    "The most central bills from our ranking script include sres254, sres292, sres193, s1616, and sres184, all with vast cosponsorship and a custom centrality measure of 9.737875, as well as slightly less central bills s1182, sres6, sres173, s1598, and s722.\n",
    "\n",
    "The least central bills include sres4, sconres1, sres16, sres7, s1848, s371, sres210, s1631, sres62, and s1662.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Bill Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting full texts of bills can prove challenging.  The ProPublica API does not supply full texts for bills.  We can obtain them by screen-scraping from the Government Publishing Office (GPO).  For example, the page with the text for sres254 is https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-115sres254ats/html/BILLS-115sres254ats.htm, while senate bill 1616 has several versions, each of which represents a state of the legislation as it goes through consideration.  The final text can be found at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-115s1616enr/html/BILLS-115s1616enr.htm .\n",
    "\n",
    "Some investigation and experimentation reveals that the URL we seek can be composed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-115s1616enr/html/BILLS-115s1616enr.htm` \n",
    "* bill stub (e.g. \"sres254\" or \"s1616\") \n",
    "* code for stage of legislation \n",
    " -  for bills we find: Introduced = \"is\", Referred in House = \"rfh\", Reported = \"rs\", Placed on Calendar = \"pcs\", Engrossed = \"es\", Enrolled = \"enr\"\n",
    " -  for resolutions we find: Introduced = \"is\" , Reported = \"rs\", Agreed to = \"ats\"\n",
    " -  more info about these codes and what they mean can be found at https://www.senate.gov/reference/Printedlegislationkey.htm or  https://www.gpo.gov/help/index.html#about_congressional_bills.htm\n",
    "* `/html/BILLS-115s`\n",
    "* bill stub \n",
    "* code for stage of legislation\n",
    "* `.htm`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the html of a given bill or resolution, we also discover that there's a non-trivial amount of metadata included, such as the legislative sponsors, which we'll want to discard for text analysis (we only want to analyze the contents of the legislation itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* identify the legislative stage of the bill or resolution so we can find the most up-to-date text\n",
    "* construct the URL\n",
    "* obtain, parse, and scrape the html\n",
    "* from the text scraped, obtain just the bill text (as opposed to the list of sponsors, for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up a few variables with data we'll need."
